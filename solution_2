/*
Design a class that can be used by a health care professional to keep track of a patient’s vital statistics. The following are the details.
Name of the class - Patient
Member Variables - patientName(String),height(double),width(double)
Member Function - double computeBMI()
The above method should compute the BMI and return the result. The formula for computation of BMI  is weight (in kg) ÷ height*height(in metres).
Create an object of the Patient class and check the results.
